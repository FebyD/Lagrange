Once upon a time a little girl I was knew loved to be one with nature, drawling, watching tv, eating, whatever the activity was. She was so full of life, seeing the good through the bad. She loved to read the biology book and she could watch crime documentaries for hours, longing to know the psychology of the killers. She may seem odd to some, but something suddenly changed about this girl. 
What was she doing now? Now she can barely make pasta without wondering about her mother’s scrutiny of her method; she cannot read anything without thinking about what she must do after she’s done; she’s paralyzed by the fear that she’s not getting enough things done…which ironically doesn’t allow her to get much accomplished. She’s worried about the future whilst trying to find meaning and enjoyment in the present. Provoking thoughts of her childhood, feelings of never measuring up dictate her productivity of the now. She is a juggler trying to balance the “balls” of life, except she’s ill prepared and terrified, not even knowing which balls she can start to juggle.
Unfortunately, life is like an automatic ball launcher and she must do well in catching and juggling those balls, at least that’s what she’s learned.
Currently reading Dr. Sonja Lyubomirsky’s book The How of Happiness, activity number nine “Living in the Present” reminded me quickly of that little girl. Her section on “Savoring Life’s Joys” really spoke to me.  She starts off this section by highlighting some of the things children grow up hearing, for example, parents tell their children to be good so that they grow up to be good, moral citizens. Teacher tell their students to study hard in order to gain good grades and good jobs later on.  Senior citizens tell their friends about the golden years of retirement. And so on. Basically, she’s saying that from childhood and onward to adulthood, we are taught to observe the significance of future planning/ living.  One sentence that stood out from the page to me was this, she said, “We postpone our happiness, convincing ourselves that tomorrow will be better than today” (Lybuomirsky. P.191). We postpone? Wow did she paint reality with that paint brush of words. “If I just drag this day out and get it over with, I’ll relax and be happy tomorrow” is a phrase I hear often from my college peers and one I often say to myself. And what is the result? Tomorrow’s forecast wasn’t what we had predicted at all. Dr. Lyubomirsky suggests many tips on savoring life’s joy, but two connected with me deeply. Number one, be mindful, to ground yourself in the present moment, meditate. Number two, take pleasure in the senses. Being careful observers and delighting in momentary pleasures. It doesn’t matter what it is, concentrating on the sweetness of a mango, the juice filled pockets of a pomegranate, the swift brushstrokes of a painter, you name it, you can savor it. Why? Because life’s joys are all around us, waiting for us to notice those which have been forsaken, like eating chocolate and only eating the chocolate (Lybuomirsky. P.198, 199). The last happiness activity she mentioned was “Religion and Spirituality”, one in which I partake in daily. I like that mentioned this as an activity, a habit one can form. Not in a preaching way, because she doesn’t seem to side toward one main religion, however in a proactive and encouraging way. She describes one who has a relationship with God like this, “This relationship is not only a source of comfort in troubled times but a source of self-esteem, feeling unconditionally valued, loved, and cared for…it will give you a sense of calm and peace” (Lybuomirsky. P.230). In my personal life, this is what I hang on to the most. She goes on to talk about a belief in a God is the belief that God is in control, that God means well, that things will be okay because they are all a part of grander picture, a divine one. 
So to the little girl I once knew, take heart, go back out and enjoy the roses, the sun, the chocolate bar. Open your mind again to new ideas, do what you can and believe that you can do whatever it is you want. Savor life’s joys though they may not be so joyful at times, yet seek them out! And so to the little girl that is now 20 years old and writing this blog report, this is for you.
